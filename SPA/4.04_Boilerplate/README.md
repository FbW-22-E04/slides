### Ongoing Examples / Tasks

The following entries represent tasks and stages in the SPA module's live coding project. Each link is an overview of the tasks that need to be achieved, and each solution is the example to be live coded in front of the class. To use these examples follow the steps below:

1. Check out the corresponding task branch, and explain to you class what is going to be done in the next live coding example.
1. On a different screen, use the solution branch as a guide, as you live code your solution (check the change log to see which files were changed).
1. For tasks that include more than one change, live code the first change in front of the class, and then delegate the rest of the task to the learners (use your judgment regarding the class' level to decide how much of the task they should achieve)
