# SPA-4.1 - DOM

## Overview

The built in DOM apis in the browser is the first stepping stone in creating a truly dynamic experience. In this sub module, the learners will be acquainted with writing JavaScript for the browser environment, and use it to explore and manipulate the document structure. Making the web interactive, requires us to attach functionality and react to actions the user might perform on our page. 

### Objectives

By the end of this sub module, learners should be able to:

- Add scripts to an HTML document
- Select, add, remove and manipulate elements from the DOM
- Add and remove event listeners to and from elements in the DOM
- Use common keyboard, mouse and form events to execute code
- Use event delegation techniques to optimize the user experience
- Identify resources for further information on the DOM api
